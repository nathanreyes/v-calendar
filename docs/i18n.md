# i18n

VCalendar utilizes the [well supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=internationalization) Internationalization API to derive month and weekday names and formatting. This helps keep the package size down, as well as supporting multiple locales in the most performant and isomorphic way.

## Locales

A locale includes multiple settings that are typically assigned on a per region basis. This currently includes the following:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `firstDayOfWeek` | The day the specified the first day of the week. This is a number from 1 to 7 (Sunday to Saturday, respectfully). |
| `masks` | Set of masks to use for common sections of the calendar including the title, weekday labels, month labels in the navigation pane and more. |
| `dayNames` | Full length identifiers for the days of the week. |
| `dayNamesShort` | 3-character identifiers for the days of the week. |
| `dayNamesShorter` | 2-character identifiers for the days of the week. |
| `dayNamesNarrow` | 1-character identifiers for the days of the week. |
| `monthNames` | Full length identifiers for the months of the year. |
| `monthNamesShort` | Abbreviated identifiers for the months of the year. |

There are multiple ways which you can configure the locale for a specific calendar. Locales may be configured globally via the defaults object as well as on a per-calendar basis with the `locale` prop.

BUT `dayNames`, `dayNamesShort`, `dayNamesShorter`, `dayNamesNarrow`, `monthNames`, `monthNamesShort` DONT WORK IN VUE 3.

## Default Locale

```html
<v-calendar />
```

With no locale specified, the locale detected by the Internationalization API is used.

## Default Locale and Props

```html
<v-calendar :first-day-of-week="2" :masks="{ title: 'MMM YYYY' }" />
```

<div class="example">
  <v-calendar :first-day-of-week="2" :masks="{ title: 'MMM YYYY' }" />
</div>

Uses the detected locale with customized `firstDayOfWeek` or `masks` that will override the built-in locale settings. When using a customized `masks` prop, the default masks will supply any masks that are missing, so you are free to provide single overrides.

## String Locales

```html
<v-calendar locale="es" />
```

<div class="example">
  <v-calendar locale="es" />
</div>

With a string locale, the locale with the matching identifier is used. The Internationalization API is used to generate the `dayNames`, `dayNamesShort`, `dayNamesShorter`, `dayNamesNarrow`, `monthNames` and `monthNamesShort` properties.

Because the API does not provide common values for the `firstDayOfWeek` or `masks` these are loaded from the plugin defaults (unless specifically provided via props).

#### Object Locales

```html
<v-calendar :locale="{ id: 'da', firstDayOfWeek: 2, masks: { weekdays: 'WW' } }" />
```

<div class="example">
  <v-calendar :locale="{ id: 'da', firstDayOfWeek: 2, masks: { weekdays: 'WW' } }" />
</div>

With an object locale, you can simply provide all the settings you need together in a single object.

Note that `firstDayOfWeek` and `masks` props will override this object.

#### Global Locales

More conveniently, you may override or provide missing locale information via the `locales` property of the defaults object when using VCalendar. This should be an object with the locale identifier as the key and an object with the locale settings.

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VCalendar from 'v-calendar'

Vue.use(VCalendar, {
  locales: {
    'pt-PT': {
      firstDayOfWeek: 1,
      masks: {
        L: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
        // ...optional `title`, `weekdays`, `navMonths`, etc
      }
    }
  }
});
```

Then, all you need to do is reference your locale when using the calendar component.

```html
<v-calendar locale="pt-PT" />
```

<div class="example">
  <v-calendar locale="pt-PT" />
</div>
